# 📊 Sorting Visualizer

Welcome to the **Sorting Visualizer** project! This web application allows users to visualize various sorting algorithms in action, providing a clear understanding of how different algorithms work with real-time animations, built with **Next.js**.

---

## 🌟 **Features**

- **Interactive Visualization** of popular sorting algorithms such as:
  - Bubble Sort
  - Selection Sort
  - Insertion Sort
  - Merge Sort
  - Quick Sort
  - Heap Sort
- **Dynamic Array Generation**: Users can create arrays of different sizes and values for sorting.
- **Speed Control**: Adjust the speed of the sorting animations for better observation.
- **Step-by-Step Execution**: View each step of the sorting process in real-time.

## 🚀 **Tech Stack**

- **Frontend**:
  - [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/): React framework for server-rendered applications.
  - [React.js](https://reactjs.org/): For building the user interface and managing state.
  - [CSS3](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS): Styling for a visually appealing interface.
  - [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript): Core logic for implementing sorting algorithms.
